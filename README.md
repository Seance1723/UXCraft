# UI/UX Master

The one-stop UI/UX skill for AI coding agents.

Use it with a normal prompt plus one trigger:

```text
/ui-ux-master audit this dashboard and give me implementation-ready fixes
```

If `/ui-ux-master` is not present, the installed rules tell agents not to use the skill. That keeps your normal coding workflow clean and makes UI/UX mode explicit.

## Why Use UI/UX Master?

Most AI UI prompts produce pretty screens but miss the hard parts: research assumptions, information architecture, accessibility, responsive states, design-system consistency, platform conventions, localization, ethics, and developer handoff.

UI/UX Master is built to make agents behave like a senior product designer, UX researcher, accessibility reviewer, design-system lead, and frontend handoff partner in one workflow.

## What Makes It Different

| Common open-source prompt/skill | UI/UX Master |
|---|---|
| Focuses on visual polish only | Covers research, UX strategy, IA, flows, UI, accessibility, content, metrics, and handoff |
| Always-on rules that interfere with normal coding | Opt-in `/ui-ux-master` trigger only |
| One agent or editor only | Cross-agent templates for Claude, Codex, Windsurf, Antigravity, Gemini, Cursor, and universal agents |
| Generic design advice | Concrete templates, checklists, quality gates, and implementation rules |
| No persistent design memory | Project `.ui-ux-memory.md` workflow keeps brand/design decisions consistent |
| Weak accessibility coverage | WCAG 2.2 AA plus advanced ARIA/widget patterns and test matrix |
| No deployment validation | Release validator, npm package metadata, tests, and deployment zip builder |
| No product-risk coverage | Ethics, privacy, dark-pattern, high-risk domain, AI-interface, and inclusive-design checks |

## Capabilities

UI/UX Master can help agents produce:

- Product UX strategy and user goals
- UX research plans, evidence confidence, and research synthesis
- Information architecture, navigation, taxonomy, and search/filter models
- User flows, task flows, journey maps, and service blueprints
- Wireframes, layout specs, visual direction, and interaction design
- Accessibility audits and WCAG 2.2 AA remediation guidance
- Advanced component accessibility patterns for dialogs, tabs, comboboxes, menus, grids, live regions, and drag/drop alternatives
- Design systems, tokens, component specs, governance, and usage rules
- Content design, UX writing, error copy, empty states, localization, RTL, and i18n checks
- Platform-specific guidance for web, iOS, Android/Material, Windows/desktop, kiosk, email, TV, and universal agents
- SaaS dashboards, data visualization, tables, alerts, ecommerce, checkout, onboarding, settings, auth, forms, and landing pages
- Ethical UX, privacy, consent, dark-pattern detection, AI transparency, and high-risk domain safeguards
- Developer handoff with states, tokens, responsive behavior, analytics events, QA, and acceptance criteria

## Install with npm

Global install:

```bash
npm install -g ui-ux-master
ui-ux-master install --global
```

Project-local install, recommended:

```bash
npm install --save-dev ui-ux-master
npx ui-ux-master install --project
```

No-save project install (copies reusable skill files into `.ui-ux-master/` so agents can still read the source after npx exits):

```bash
npx ui-ux-master install --project
```

Install only selected agents:

```bash
npx ui-ux-master install --project --agents claude,codex,windsurf,gemini,cursor
```

Dry run:

```bash
npx ui-ux-master install --project --dry-run
```

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Install target | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/commands/ui-ux-master.md` | native `/ui-ux-master` command |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` marked section | type `/ui-ux-master` |
| Windsurf/Cascade | `.windsurf/rules/ui-ux-master.md` and `.windsurfrules` fallback | type `/ui-ux-master` |
| Antigravity | `AGENTS.md` plus `.antigravity/rules/ui-ux-master.md` fallback | type `/ui-ux-master` |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` marked section | type `/ui-ux-master` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/ui-ux-master.mdc` | type `/ui-ux-master` |
| Other agents | `agent-templates/universal/ui-ux-master-trigger.md` | copy trigger into instruction file |

See `docs/slash-command-compatibility.md` for details.

## Usage Examples

```text
/ui-ux-master redesign this SaaS onboarding flow for faster activation and create dev handoff specs
```

```text
/ui-ux-master audit the checkout flow for accessibility, trust, conversion, and mobile UX
```

```text
/ui-ux-master create a design system starter for this app using the existing components and tokens
```

```text
/ui-ux-master inspect this dashboard and improve hierarchy, data visualization, empty states, and responsive behavior
```

```text
/ui-ux-master turn this rough product idea into IA, user flows, wireframes, content, metrics, and implementation tasks
```

## CLI Commands

```bash
ui-ux-master install --project
ui-ux-master install --global
ui-ux-master install --project --agents claude,codex,windsurf,antigravity,gemini,cursor
ui-ux-master install --project --dry-run
ui-ux-master doctor
ui-ux-master where
ui-ux-master uninstall --project
```

## Package Structure

## Validation and Testing

Run from this folder:

```bash
python scripts/validate_skill.py --release
npm test
npm pack --dry-run

python scripts/build_deployment_zip.py
```

Expected validation result:

```text
PASS: UI/UX skill package is valid
Release mode: PASS
```

## Competitive Positioning

UI/UX Master is designed to outperform narrow UI prompt packs and simple design rules by combining:

1. Opt-in activation: no pollution of normal coding prompts.
2. Cross-agent portability: one package for Claude, Codex, Windsurf, Antigravity, Gemini, Cursor, and generic agents.
3. Full lifecycle coverage: discovery to deployment handoff.
4. Standards alignment: WCAG, WAI-ARIA patterns, GOV.UK, NN/g, Material, Apple HIG, Microsoft, Baymard-style ecommerce practice, ISO human-centered design concepts.
5. Project memory: durable brand/design consistency via `.ui-ux-memory.md`.
6. Release engineering: npm packaging, CLI installer, validation, tests, and deployment zip.
7. Advanced risk coverage: ethics, privacy, dark patterns, localization, platform conventions, high-risk domains, and AI UX transparency.

## Deployment Readiness Checklist

- [ ] `python scripts/validate_skill.py --release` passes.
- [ ] `npm test` passes.
- [ ] `npm pack --dry-run` contains only intended files.
- [ ] `ui-ux-master install --project --dry-run` works.
- [ ] Agent templates contain `/ui-ux-master` and do not include local absolute paths.
- [ ] No `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.pyc`, graphify cache, coverage, logs, secrets, or local credentials are included.

## Known Limitations

- It guides research planning but does not replace real users.
- It helps accessibility review but does not replace expert assistive-technology testing for high-risk products.
- It flags legal/privacy/health/finance risks but does not replace legal or domain-expert review.
- Brand and competitor sites change; verify live claims before citing them as facts.
- Agents without native slash commands use `/ui-ux-master` as a text trigger through installed instruction files.
